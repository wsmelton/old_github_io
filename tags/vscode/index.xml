      <description>If you have not started using Visual Studio Code just yet you can take a look at the intro videos on the basics. One item that is dug into the documentation that I have commonly seen asked on SO a few times is around the PowerShell extension and the extension&amp;rsquo;s Integrated Terminal.
The main question asked is around creating the profile, or they already have a profile for PowerShell but the integrated terminal is not &amp;ldquo;seeing&amp;rdquo; it (or picking it up).</description>

      <description>In aprevious post on PowerShell Editors I included Visual Studio Code (Code) in that list. In this post I wanted to introduce Code a bit more to you, and walk you through how you can interact with GitHub repositories. I mean now a days, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a GitHub account?
Now I will make a caveat that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into the workflow and details of how Git works.</description>
