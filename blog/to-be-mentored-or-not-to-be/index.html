<p>This happens to be the first post of 2015 for me, and actually one of the few non-technical post I have written. Paul Randal recently posted on Twitter offering to mentor a select number individuals.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RT [Blog] Want to be mentored by me? <a href="http://t.co/AGTpagin08">http://t.co/AGTpagin08</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sql?src=hash">#sql</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sqlserver?src=hash">#sqlserver</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sqlfamily?src=hash">#sqlfamily</a></p>&mdash; Paul Randal (@PaulRandal) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulRandal/status/561197482546188288">January 30, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Which I have read he also does this for a select few that go through the SQL Skills courses as well. Just one more thing to put on that &ldquo;How great is Paul Randal&rdquo; list we all keep up with.</p>

<p>I can say that I have been through one mentoring program (or more an <a href="/2011-04-20-the-mentoring-experiment-2/" target="_blank">experiment</a>) back in 2011 in my career. This program actually introduced me to Tim Mitchell (<a href="http://www.timmitchell.net/" target="_blank">blog</a><code>|</code><a href="http://twitter.com\Tim_Mitchell" target="_blank">twitter</a>) and am very grateful for the time spent on phone calls and emails. My current employer at the time did not really put me in a situation that I could take full advantage of the advice received but it did help none the less. I was employed as a DBA but not doing a high amount of &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; work in SQL Server.</p>

<p>I have changed employers a few times since then and in June of 2013 decided to leave the confines of an office and started doing full time SQL Server consulting work from home. I began working with a company out of Wisconsin. Which today is actually my last day with this company. I have decided to make a change and will be going to work at Pythian starting in February. Any new job starting off will offer new challenges but I think Pythian has an environment that I can expand my knowledge of SQL Server in and other technologies as well.</p>

<h3 id="so-should-i-be-mentored-by-paul">So, should I be mentored by Paul?</h3>

<p>Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to be mentored by Paul Randal. Do I deserve to be? You can always second-guess yourself thinking I am to far down the totem poll to deserve Paul&rsquo;s time. I try not to look at things like that, most of the time. I have held a lot of different jobs in my career and numerous other part-time jobs. I am hoping to be in this new position for some time, at least plan to. My head is full of little tidbits of information and I know full of holes. I think being mentored by someone at Paul&rsquo;s level, that has seen it all by now would help me narrow down goals. Those goals that will make sure what I am doing lines up with where I want to go (or maybe should go).</p>

<p>I have always just tried to learn anything and everything I can about SQL Server. Which some of it I can retain and some of it I don&rsquo;t; maybe little bits I recall but have to go back and look up again. I have heard folks state that SQL Server is a large product and no one person is going to learn it all to an expert level. I began to realize that more doing consultant work, and how much I don&rsquo;t know. It would help to just get down the best path that matches up to my personality and what I want to become (both in training and career).</p>

<p>If it is not to be, then it is what it is. I will keep chugging along in hopes that one day I make it to an <a href="https://www.sqlskills.com/sql-server-training/iepto1/" target="_blank">IEPT01 class</a>.</p>
