<p>If you have not heard yet I submitted an email in a <a href="http://facility9.com/2010/07/03/msdn-2010-contest" target="_blank">contest</a> a few months back now, that was run by Jeremiah Peschka (<a href="http://facility9.com/" target="_blank">blog </a><code>|</code> <a href="http://twitter.com/peschkaj" target="_blank">twitter</a>) for 1 of 3 MSDN subscriptions. I found out not long after that I was one of the <a href="http://facility9.com/2010/07/12/msdn-contest-winners" target="_blank">winners</a>.</p>

<p>With the contest Jeremiah wanted to know how we would use it. The short answer of what I sent him, I mentioned I wanted to speak more at my local <a href="http://ug.gitca.org/sites/MWITPG/default.aspx" target="_blank">user group</a> and to not really advance my career but advance my knowledge on things that I can then turn around and share with you (if  &ldquo;you&rdquo; are out there).</p>

<p>So, with having been wrapped up in some family things the past month and I have now aquired a second job (part-time) working nights at Alfa Insurance on the weekends, my time for the learning and blogging has been cut a little short.</p>

<p>However, don&rsquo;t fear&hellip;I have had some new thoughts while building my virtual lab on my desktop at home now that I have access to the MSDN subscription.  My first though is: I need a laptop. Sitting in a confortable chair, or even my bed is much more appealing than sitting at the desk to work. Anyway, I have been reading more on PowerShell recently and have am very interested in learning it.</p>

<p>So my plans for the future:
- Write some articles for <a href="http://mssharepointtips.com" target="_blank">MSSharePointTips.com</a> about SharePoint and PowerShell
- Blog here about what I&rsquo;m still learning with SQL Server
- Blog here about what I&rsquo;m learning about PowerShell (which this should keep me busy since everything is new :))</p>

<p>Hopefully during this you will learn something that will benefit you and help you in some manner of your job.</p>
