    <p>So I got a new server given to me to check over. Unlike most folks I like to open up PowerShell to get quick fix on the configuration. I seem to have gotten used to using PowerShell enough now that it takes me about as much time to do it PowerShell as it would in SSMS. So I like hitting the keyboard more than I do clicking the mouse.</p>

<p>It is a Window Server 2008 box and SQL Server 2008 R2 so I know PowerShell is available to me for my perusing.</p>

<p>Open up PowerShell firing off a few commands as such:</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">[System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName('Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo') | Out-Null
$s = New-Object 'Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Server' MyInstance
</code></pre>

<p>So good so far. I then go to check a few things to find out what the build number is and what the directory path is for the instance.</p>

<p><code>$s.Information.version</code></p>

<p>This will give you the Major, Minor, Build, and Revision information of that instance. It returns that no issue. However the next command returns nothing:</p>

<p><code>$s.Information.RootDirectory</code></p>

<p>What this should have given me is the path to the files for that instance on the server. The <code>\MSSQL10_50.InstanceName\MSSQL\</code> path. However all it did was send me back to a prompt, without any output or error message. So I decided to just look at all of the information to see if it returned anything.</p>

<p><code>$s.Information</code></p>

<p>Which that line returns an error that looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>format-default : An exception occurred while executing a Transact-SQL statement or batch.
+ CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [format-default], ExecutionFailureException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ExecutionFailureException,Microsoft...
</code></pre>

<p>Which did not really help me, but I had an idea it had something to do with my permissions not being setup correctly. So I took that CategoryInfo line and popped it into the mighty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_%28The_Matrix%29" target="_blank">Oracle</a> (aka Google). The first link that came up was a blog post from 2009 by Michiel Wories on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mwories/archive/2009/06/08/powershell-tips-tricks-getting-more-detailed-error-information-from-powershell.aspx" target="_blank">how to get more detailed error information from PowerShell</a>. Which stemmed from a blog post Allen White (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/allen_white/default.aspx" target="_blank">b</a><code>|</code><a href="http://twitter.com/SQLRunr" target="_blank">t</a>) had written on actually how to <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/allen_white/archive/2009/06/08/handling-errors-in-powershell.aspx" target="_blank">handle errors in PowerShell</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently the message outputted to the console does not include all of the error. There is an &ldquo;InnerException&rdquo; that has all the meat of the error. To get that you can execute the command below. Now I believe you can only do this if you are working interactively with the console. If you are running a script you would need to check Allen&rsquo;s post to see how you can capture the error itself when your script is executed.</p>

<p><code>$error[0] | Format-List InnerException -Force</code></p>

<p>From the output of this command I see the rest of the story:</p>

<pre><code>An exception occurred while executing a Transact-SQL statement or batch. ---&amp;gt; The EXECUTE permission was denied on the ojbect 'xp_instance_regread', database 'mssqlsystemresource', schema 'sys'.
The EXECUTE permissions was denied...on and on.
</code></pre>

<p>Each object that should have been returned from executing <code>$s.Information</code> shows the <code>EXECUTE permission denied</code> message for that object. Which by itself is cool because you see what is happening in the background, and I now know what is being executed to return that information to me.</p>

<p>So now you know how to get to this information when you get an error in PowerShell that just may not give you enough info to go on. I am now off to get my permissions fixed.</p>
