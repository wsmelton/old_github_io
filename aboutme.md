I live in Alabama, and grew up in the country cutting wood for the winter and baling hay in the summer. My college career started out wanting to go into Wildlife Science, but biology proved to be my weakness. Switched to degree in information systems and made it out of college.

I have worked in various operation support roles in my career. Which while some may look at my resume and say I was jumping between jobs, there is more to the story. I worked as contractor with the military for a good portion of my career, so as the contract went to another company I followed along. One advantage I think that has given me is over my career: I have been involved in the whole development process (*maybe not at the same company*) and seen it from various sides.

SQL Server has been my life since around 2008 or so, when I first started supporting the product. While I enjoy all components of SQL Server, I am keen on the Business Intelligence parts. Then there is PowerShell, that I will use any chance I can. 

### certifications

Yeah I have a few Microsoft SQL Server certs (2005 and 2008), also have cert on AWS Architecture.

### my resume

Who uses resume anymore? [Just go check my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/wshawnmelton).

### contributions
I have become a contributor with the [dbatools PowerShell module](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools) under the [sqlcalloborative project on GitHub](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative). It is a SQL Server Community project that includes dbatools and dbareports.

### finding waldo
