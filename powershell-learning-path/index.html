<p>How much do you automate in your job? The question is not necessarily specific to SQL Server, whether you work as a system administrator or even business analyst. There are areas of your job that can be, and should be, automated. Ok, now back to SQL Server specifics&hellip;</p>

<h1 id="day-to-day-task">Day-To-Day Task</h1>

<p>A database administrator always has some mundane task to do each day, if they want to keep their job. These little things are the best candidates for automating, as a starting point. Once you get those automated you will see the benefit and it will help your mindset change to start thinking in that manner more and more.</p>

<h1 id="the-tool-of-choice">The Tool of Choice</h1>

<p>One tool that is growing more and more each year in both features and use, is PowerShell. As a beginner you will ask, &ldquo;what is PowerShell&rdquo;. I give you <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2015/01/02/what-is-powershell/">this quote from The Scripting Guy</a> at Microsoft that I think sums it up well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Windows PowerShell is an interactive object-oriented command environment with scripting language features that utilizes small programs called cmdlets to simplify configuration, administration, and management of heterogeneous environments in both standalone and networked typologies by utilizing standards-based remoting protocols.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="learning-path">Learning Path</h1>

<p>An endeavor at Pythian (my current employer) began a few months back to get folks mindset moved more toward automation. One of those paths for the teams that support Microsoft Data Platform products is PowerShell. I drew up a list of courses and books to give the team a learning path to take. Now mind you this is not an exhaustive list, just the ones I know worked for me and are well structured.</p>

<p>These are listed in order of progression, so if you are already familiar with certain areas you can skip over to the next.</p>

<li>Link: <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/powershell-toolmaking-fundamentals/">here</a></li>
<li>Description: PowerShell can be many things to many different people. PowerShell can be a simple command-line replacement or a scripting language. Beginners to intermediate-level scripters are probably still writing one-liners and simple scripts. They’re probably starting to see the potential of PowerShell not as a simple scripting language but as a way to build “tools” to use over and over again. Don’t recreate the wheel. Learn how to create reusable scripts so you don’t have to recreate that wheel.</li>

With Module 2, we provide an introduction to the two main tools for working with SQL Server, the SMO, or SQL Management Objects, and the SQL Server Provider. Module 3 will cover basic DBA tasks using both SMO and the SQL Provider. With Module 4 we switch to Developer mode and cover development using the SQL Provider. Module 5 continues the developer theme, this time using the SQL Management Objects. We finally wrap things up with Module 6, in which we go over a real world example of using PowerShell and SQL Server.

<li>Total Time: 1h 40m</li>
<li>Link: <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/powershell-gotchas/">here</a></li>
<li>Description: PowerShell is the de facto standard for automation and administration on Windows systems. The central design mantra in PowerShell is Think-Type-Get. That is: Think what you want, Type it, and Get the results. Unfortunately this mantra doesn’t always work - PowerShell combines concepts from other languages (Perl, Python, and VBScript for example) and borrows ideas from other platforms (like pipelining in Bash). This creates an experience that feels familiar, but fails to behave consistently with our experiences. This creates “gotchas.” In this course, we will analyze some specific cases of PowerShell’s strange behavior in order to better understand how and why PowerShell works the way it does.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="creating-powershell-modules">Creating PowerShell Modules</h3>

<ul>

The material in this course is what IT Pros who want to use DSC in their environments will be using in production. We’ll look at how to build and use a pull server, including deploying resources. We’ll also explore how to use certificates to create a secure DSC environment. The course will wrap up with walkthroughs of using DSC to configure Windows and Linux servers. This course will focus on DSC as it exists in PowerShell 4.0.</li>

In this course, Practical Desired State Configuration (DSC), you’ll learn how to use Desired State Configuration by applying it to several real-world scenarios. First, you’ll learn how to expand DSC beyond its built-in resources by learning about custom DSC resources. Next, you’ll learn how to secure DSC. Then, you’ll learn how to build and administer Active Directory with DSC. Lastly, you’ll learn how to set up and configure Windows Event forwarding with DSC.

<h3 id="testing-powershell-with-pester">Testing PowerShell with Pester</h3>

<li>Total Time: 4h 11m</li>
<li>Link: <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/powershell-testing-pester/">here</a></li>
<li>Description: <em>A very good storyline naritive to show how Pester is used.</em> Having a good testing framework will ensure your PowerShell scripts function as designed, and will ensure they continue to work correctly after you make changes. In this course, Testing PowerShell with Pester, you’ll learn how to use Pester, the new open source testing tool, to create tests for all of your PowerShell scripts and modules. You’ll start with seeing how to use Pester to test an existing code base. After that, Pester will be used to validate change requests to a module. Finally, you’ll use Pester along with Test Driven Development to craft a brand new module. After watching this course, you’ll have the confidence to test and use your own PowerShell scripts in your own projects.</li>
